# One-pager: M5Stack Tab5 Development Emulator

## 1. TL;DR
A desktop emulator for the M5Stack Tab5 that enables developers to build, test, and debug Tab5 applications without physical hardware. This tool provides accurate device simulation with complete file management capabilities and a smooth development experience, reducing development cycles and hardware dependency for Tab5 app creators.

## 2. Goals
### Business Goals
* Accelerate Tab5 ecosystem growth by lowering development barriers
* Reduce support requests related to hardware debugging issues  
* Enable faster developer onboarding and prototyping
* Increase Tab5 platform adoption through improved developer experience

### User Goals
* Test Tab5 applications without requiring physical hardware
* Debug code efficiently with desktop development tools
* Manage files seamlessly between development environment and emulated device
* Validate UI/UX designs across different Tab5 configurations
* Collaborate on projects without hardware sharing constraints

### Non-Goals
* Real-time hardware sensor simulation (accelerometer, GPS, etc.)
* Production deployment or device flashing capabilities
* Advanced performance profiling or optimization tools
* Support for non-Tab5 M5Stack devices in initial release

## 3. User stories
**Primary Persona: Tab5 Application Developer**
* As a developer, I want to test my Tab5 app's UI without physical hardware so I can iterate quickly on design changes
* As a developer, I want to upload and manage files in the emulated environment so I can test file-dependent features
* As a developer, I want accurate screen rendering so I can ensure my app looks correct on actual Tab5 devices
* As a developer, I want to simulate touch interactions so I can test user input handling

**Secondary Persona: Educator/Workshop Leader**
* As an educator, I want to demonstrate Tab5 development to students without requiring multiple devices
* As a workshop leader, I want participants to start coding immediately without hardware setup delays

## 4. Functional requirements
### High Priority (P0)
* Accurate Tab5 display emulation with correct resolution and color reproduction
* Touch input simulation with multi-touch support
* File system emulation with drag-and-drop file management
* Core Tab5 firmware API compatibility
* Real-time code execution and debugging support

### Medium Priority (P1)
* Button and control simulation for physical Tab5 inputs
* Network connectivity simulation for WiFi-dependent features
* Configuration presets for different Tab5 hardware variants
* Screenshot and screen recording capabilities
* Integration with popular IDEs and development tools

### Low Priority (P2)
* Custom skin themes for emulator interface
* Automated testing framework integration
* Multi-device emulation for testing device communication
* Performance metrics and resource monitoring

## 5. User experience
### Primary User Journey
* Launch emulator application from desktop or IDE
* Select Tab5 configuration or load existing project
* Drag and drop application files into emulated file system
* Run application and interact via mouse/keyboard simulation
* Debug and iterate using familiar development tools
* Export or sync changes back to development environment

### Edge Cases and UI Notes
* Handle large file uploads with progress indicators and error handling
* Provide clear visual feedback when emulation accuracy limitations are reached
* Include tooltips and help documentation for emulator-specific features
* Support window resizing while maintaining aspect ratio
* Graceful error handling for unsupported Tab5 firmware features

## 6. Narrative
Sarah, a freelance IoT developer, receives a contract to build a data visualization app for the M5Stack Tab5. Instead of ordering hardware and waiting for delivery, she downloads the Tab5 emulator and starts prototyping immediately. Within minutes, she's testing her initial UI mockup, uploading sample data files through the intuitive drag-and-drop interface, and seeing her charts render exactly as they would on the physical device.

When her client requests changes, Sarah quickly iterates on the design, taking screenshots directly from the emulator for approval. She discovers a file parsing bug during testingâ€”the emulator's accurate file system simulation caught an edge case she might have missed until deployment. By the time the physical Tab5 arrives, Sarah's app is already polished and ready for final hardware validation, cutting her development time in half.

## 7. Success metrics
