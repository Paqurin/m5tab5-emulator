Archon Integration & Workflow
CRITICAL: This project uses Archon for knowledge management, task tracking, and project organization.
Core Archon Workflow Principles
The Golden Rule: Task-Driven Development with Archon

MANDATORY: Always complete the full Archon task cycle before any coding:
Check Current Task → Review task details and requirements
Research for Task → Search relevant documentation and examples
Implement the Task → Write code based on research
Update Task Status → Move task from "todo" → "doing" → "review"
Get Next Task → Check for next priority task
Repeat Cycle

Task Management Rules:
Update all actions to Archon
Move tasks from "todo" → "doing" → "review" (not directly to complete)
Maintain task descriptions and add implementation notes
DO NOT MAKE ASSUMPTIONS - check project documentation for questions
use the correct agents to properly repair the issues. 
if there is a function missing, attempt to create it.
document all the related files and add the issues to archon to critical backlog, prioritize the bugs and errors relative to the operating systems core requirements.
update claude.md when do, use exa and ref mcp servers to research
