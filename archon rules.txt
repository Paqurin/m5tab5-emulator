Archon Integration & Workflow
CRITICAL: This project uses Archon for knowledge management, task tracking, and project organization.
Core Archon Workflow Principles
The Golden Rule: Task-Driven Development with Archon

MANDATORY: Always complete the full Archon task cycle before any coding:
check for prior unfinished tasks.
Check Current Task → Review task details and requirements
Research for Task → Search relevant documentation and examples
Implement the Task → Write code based on research
Update Task Status → Move task from "todo" → "doing" → "review"
Get Next Task → Check for next priority task
Repeat Cycle

Task Management Rules:
Update all actions to Archon
Move tasks from "todo" → "doing" → "review" (not directly to complete)
Maintain task descriptions and add implementation notes
DO NOT MAKE ASSUMPTIONS - check project documentation for questions
read claude.md prd.md and implementation.md for overarching goals and program structure 
begin connecting the buttons in the menus to their proper functions
break the task down into smaller sprints.
use exa and ref mcp servers for any needed research
use the appropriate team of agents to accomplish the tasks 
if there is a function missing, attempt to create it.
document all related file changes made during the task. 
cleanup the file structure and code changes when done.
